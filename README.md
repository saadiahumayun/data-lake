# Creating a Data Lake to organise data pipeline for exploration of Twitter sentiment impact on cryptocurrency valuation
Cryptocurrency is a relatively new asset class and is still subject to a lot of uncertainty and volatility. As a result, cryptocurrency prices can be highly unpredictable and subject to sudden fluctuations. 

Investor sentiments play a particular role in moving the valuation of crypto. For example, if investors have a positive outlook towards the future of a particular cryptocurrency, they may be more willing to invest in it, leading to an increase in price. Similarly, if investors have a negative outlook towards a cryptocurrency, they may sell their holdings, leading to a decrease in price. Impact of investor/ influencer sentiment on cryptocurrency is our main area of research in this project.
